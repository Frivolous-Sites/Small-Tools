# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers.  Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up.  Please consider joining the
# pool: <http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html>
#pool 0.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
#pool 1.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
#pool 2.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst
#pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst

# Customize your own upstream NTP servers below.

# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# Exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
# Uncomment the following two lines to exchange time with everybody.
#restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited
#restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery limited

# Block everyone; however, allow 104.168.248.130 to exchange time.
